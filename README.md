# 💻 DiscordRepair

**DiscordRepair** is a lightweight Windows utility designed to fix the **black screen issue** that sometimes appears when launching Discord.  
It automatically clears corrupted cache files, disables hardware acceleration, and restarts Discord safely.

## 🚀 Features
- 🧹 Clears all Discord cache folders (`Cache`, `Code Cache`, `GPUCache`)
- ⚙️ Disables hardware acceleration (a common cause of black screen)
- 🔁 Restarts Discord automatically after repair
- 🪄 Simple one-click installation

---

## 📦 Installation
1. Download the latest **DiscordRepair Setup** from the [Releases](../../releases) page.  
2. Run **`setup.exe`** and follow the on-screen instructions.  
3. After installation, you can launch **DiscordRepair** from the Start Menu or Desktop shortcut.

## 🧰 How It Works
DiscordRepair performs safe maintenance tasks only:
- It stops the `Discord.exe` process
- Deletes cached data and GPU cache
- Updates `settings.json` to disable hardware acceleration if enabled
- Starts Discord again

No Discord files are modified — this tool only automates safe, user-level fixes.
